  	  <p>Vineeth Sreenivasan is a celebrated musician, screenwriter and actor but I firmly believe that his true craft comes through in his vivid, imaginative and soul-stirring direction, lending heart and joy to even the most cliché and commonplace narratives. Hridayam is not a new story by any stretch of the imagination but the deft hand of Malayalam’s most beloved director in the nostalgic romance genre weaves his magic wand to create a canvas that instantly builds a connection with audiences and reels you in as the story moves along.

We are taken through the life of Arun Neelakantan (Pranav Mohanlal), first as the quintessential reluctant millennial engineering student, new to Chennai and experiencing ragging, love and heartbreak all at once. Having done my engineering in the exact same batch (2006-2010) as the characters in the storyline, the nostalgia of it all was hitting me in waves, scene after scene as everything from the bulky mobile phones to the ragging to the struggle to clear semester exams took me back to what was definitely the "good old days".

Darshana Rajendran is expectedly terrific as Arun’s college girlfriend lending her own distinct voice to a nuanced character that would have come off as petulant and even childish if handled by an actress of lesser calibre. She is the centrepiece that holds the narrative together, generating the moments of conflict that takes the initial story forward and finally playing a compelling role in the final act as well. Kalyani Priyadarshan is charming and relatable as “Nithya” with the role carrying shades of “Nikhita”, another character she essayed in the blockbuster Varane Avashyamund (2020). 

I could write pages and pages about Hesham Abdul Wahab’s ethereal music in the film. You would think that he has already outdone himself with chartbusters like “Darshana” and “Onakka Munthiri”, only to be blown away by the ton of nostalgia-infused bricks that is “Manasse Manasse” and the heartwarming “Nagumo”. 

Veteran editor Ranjan Abraham and again, the deft hand of Vineeth Sreenivasan must be appreciated for infusing as many as 13 songs astutely into the narrative, never letting us feel that they are out of place or jarring. In fact, they elevate most of the clutch sequences, especially an exquisitely designed climax shot that is sure to stay with you long after you have left the theatres.

I would be amiss if I didn’t mention the exquisite coterie of supporting characters that Vineeth Sreenivasan has assembled for the film. Aswath Lal as Arun’s best friend “Abraham” and Kalesh Ramanand as “Selva” are the standout performers, generating some of the best emotional moments in the film while Aju Varghese and Johny Antony deliver genuine laugh-out-loud moments to add a humour dimension where the story would have otherwise seemed to drift a bit.

Ultimately, Hridayam is a mesmeric, nostalgia-laden coming-of-age musical that warms the soul. Master director in Vineeth Sreenivasan has managed to design a character that is tailor-made to fit Pranav Mohanlal’s strengths and the young actor has, in turn, put in an earnest performance that ranks right up there with Prithviraj in “Classmates” (2006) or Nivin Pauly in “Thattathin Marayathu” (2012).

Highly recommended! A theatre watch is ideal to really enjoy the music and to genuinely “feel” this exquisite Vineeth Sreenivasan masterpiece!</p>

          <p class="p_modal">Few football-crazy fans today may be aware that India was once called the Brazil of Asia . Or that the rivalry between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan is ranked among the top fifty club rivalries in the world. Brilliant players, world-class coaches and passionate fans including political leaders once combined to make India a footballworshipping nation. Thriving in several places apart from Calcutta, football was a source of the finest sports entertainment for most of the twentieth century. The game was also inextricably linked to community identity, shrewdly used towards political ends and contributed richly to our cultural heritage. In Barefoot to Boots, foremost commentator Novy Kapadia reveals Indian football s glorious legacy through riveting descriptions and analysis of on- field action, stories of memorable matches, lively anecdotes, and exclusive conversations with legendary players and officials. Charting the eventful journey of the sport up to the present, the book will enthral old and new fans alike. It will offer invaluable insight into the future of the game as the Indian Super League dramatically changes the face of domestic football and India hosts the U-17 World Cup for the first time.<br>

          <p class="p_modal">Sportswriters were critical. There were no concrete plans for the national football team. No sustained or coherent training. Unfortunately, the Indian teams were mocked. Ciric Milovan, the Yugoslavia coach, who had served as the Indian coach for a brief period in the 80s, made us believe that India can give a good account against any country in the world. Many of us remembered how Indian footballers put up a brave fight against Carlos Bilardo's probable World Cup squad of Argentina at the Eden Gardens. But why had he left the country? Utter disgrace. And, before he left the country what was his comment? It is revealed in pages of Kick off. What is India's National Football League? I have often faced the question even from my friends in the Asian Football Confederation, blissfully unaware that it does not have a National League. FIFA guidelines do not allow any private company to run a National League. Yet, AIFF signed an agreement with the founding Chairperson of Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), Mrs. Nita Ambani, wife of India's richest business personality, Mukesh Ambani. Incidentally, India is the only soccer-playing nation where promotion or relegation rules do not exist.It was argued by the AIFF President, Mr. Praful Patel, the former Union Minister, that under the patronage of a corporate house, Indian football would make tremendous progress, particularly with the introduction of ISL, the Professional League.But where does Indian football stand now? A look at the book will reveal where Indian football stands in different age group tournaments as well as our senior national team, with facts and figures, since the emergence of the new look of Indian football management.Peter Velappan, the eminent soccer administrator, who had served as the secretary of the Asian Football Confederation for more than a decade, and with whom I had worked for a year, in 2004, in Malaysia as a media officer and a consultant in the Vision Asia project, always reminded: ''Please, do not mix sports and politics, or else the standard of Indian soccer will never come up.” Since 1988, Indian football is being controlled by two politicians.The book has been written, keeping in mind the readers of all ages, as well as soccer followers all over the world, dissecting the reason for the ills prevailing in Indian soccer, a country with a population of 135 crores.
